Lecture 48 - Absolute positioning
- Absolute positioning is relative to the parent. Example given was an image
inside of a div. Give the image absolute positioning and the right: 30px property
and the image shifts all the way to the right side of the div and then gets a
right margin of 30px from the right edge.
- Relative positioning shifts an element relative to where it would have been
with no styling. Absolute is adding a margin to its parent element.
